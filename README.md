# Career System with GUI
Career GUI Desktop Application with PYQT5

Using Python, I created a program where each person can make a career plan, save their goals and write their projects. The entire project software, whose interface I have coded using the PyQT5 library and the database using SqLite, is object-based. With the personalized encryption feature, each user can create and change a password. It is an ideal program for those who want to save their goals and projects and take a disciplined path.
